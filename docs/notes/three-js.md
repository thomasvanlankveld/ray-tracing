# Three JS

Three.js [rasterizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation), which is much faster than ray tracing. Colors are determined by [Shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading).

This library renders its image into an HTML canvas element.

~~Not sure what type of [rendering technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)#Techniques) is being used by Three.js (I think it's determined by [WebGL](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer), but I can't find it immediately on it's [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL))~~
